Title: RecycleView item property persistence issue
Description: When clicking on an item in the RecycleView, the locale property is set correctly for the first 
clicked item. However, when clicking on a second item, the locale property from the first item persists, 
leading to incorrect behavior.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on an item in the RecycleView to set its locale property.
2. Click on a different item in the RecycleView.
3. Observe that the locale property from the first item is still applied to the second item.

Error is still exists, the previous state of RootItemWidget is preserved, as example if locale is set for the
first clicked item, then it's exist in second list

This issue happens because the RecycleView reuses instances of RootItemWidget for performance, so if you set a 
property (like locale) on one item, it can persist when the widget is reused for another item unless you 
explicitly reset all properties in your RootItemWidget.
