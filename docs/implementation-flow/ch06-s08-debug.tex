# Android APK Debugging Guide

## Method 1: Android Studio Logcat
1. Open Android Studio
2. Start your virtual device (AVD)
3. Go to View > Tool Windows > Logcat
4. Install your APK: `adb install tlum_Android.apk`
5. Launch the app on the emulator
6. Watch Logcat for error messages
7. Filter by your package name: `com.tercad.tlum`

## Method 2: ADB Command Line
```bash
# Connect to device
adb devices

# Install APK
adb install tlum_Android.apk

# Clear logs and start monitoring
adb logcat -c
adb logcat | grep -i "tlum\|python\|kivy\|error\|exception"

# Launch app and watch logs
adb shell am start -n com.tercad.tlum/.PythonActivity
```

## Method 3: Specific Python/Kivy Logs
```bash
# Monitor Python-specific logs
adb logcat | grep -i "python"

# Monitor Kivy-specific logs
adb logcat | grep -i "kivy"

# Monitor crash logs
adb logcat | grep -i "crash\|fatal\|exception"
```

## Method 4: App-specific Debugging
```bash
# Get detailed app logs
adb logcat -s "PythonActivity"

# Monitor memory issues
adb logcat | grep -i "memory\|oom"

# Check permissions issues
adb logcat | grep -i "permission"
```

## Common Issues to Look For:
- Import errors (missing Python modules)
- File path issues (assets not found)
- Permission denials
- Native library loading failures
- Kivy initialization problems
- Python version compatibility issues

## Additional Debugging Steps:
1. Check if app appears in Apps list
2. Try launching from command line: `adb shell am start -n com.tercad.tlum/.PythonActivity`
3. Check app installation: `adb shell pm list packages | grep tlum`
4. Monitor system logs: `adb logcat -b system`
5. Check for crashes: `adb logcat | grep -i "crash\|fatal\|exception"`
